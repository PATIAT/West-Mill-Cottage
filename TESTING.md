- Made site live on GitHub pages early on in dev process to test on real hardware iPhone 13 PRO and iPhone 11, Mac Book Air 2015 and HP Desktop 27in. (Credit to CI Mentor for this advice).

- Word separation in files (images) were highlighted as not being consistent so files were renamed with underscores for a more consistent approach (Credit to CI Mentor for this advice).

- Contact page: Although required fields are identified via an * there is no narrative to explicitly state that fields marked with * must be completed. Therefore, a narrative was put in place above the contact form (Credit to CI Mentor for this advice).


- Based on early google lighthouse report the following was identified:
  + Re-size images and maintain aspect ratio - this was done manually using Adobe Illustrator to ensure speedier load times
  + Next gen image formats were suggested by google lighthouse but it was decided not pursue this as these formats are not supported on all browsers at this time.
