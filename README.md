## Design  

### Colour Scheme  

#### Primary Colours
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme-images/primary_colours.png"></h2>  

#### Secondary Colours
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme-images/secondary_colours.png"></h2>  

 - A simple colour scheme has been used with three primary colours and three secondary colours. The colours are all relatively light with dark type being used in contrast to give a refined and clean appearance.  

- This colour pallette has been chosen with the website imagery in mind. This is because the images are going to be what catch the user's attention.  

- I used the [Material Design Colour Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0) to decide on colour choices.  

### Typography  

- Headings are in Aboreto and normal text is in Lato. Aboreto is a cursive font which is eyecathing and sophisticated which is in keeping with the style of the holiday cottage. Therefore cursive is the fallback font should Aboreto be unavailable. Lato is a clean and legible font which is commonly used for websites all over the world. Sans serif is the fallback font should Lato be unavailable.  

### Imagery  

- The images have been provided by the business owners and offer a genuine representation of the standard of the holiday cottage. The images are therefore a very important feature of the website as they must be of high quality to portray the holiday cottage in the same light.  

- Each of the pages uses different image layouts, this is due to the focus and purpose of each page being different e.g., carousel on the home page to give a taste and more focused images on the property details page e.g., kitchen, bathroom etc.  

- Most of the images are in landscape orientation and the use of the same aspect ratio for all images allows for a consistent user experience.  

### Icons  

- All icons were sourced from Font Awesome and have been used sparingly across each page to allow for a more focused approach to catch the users attention.  

## Structure  

### Website Architecture  

- This website has a home page and a further 5 pages, namely;    Property Details, Location, Activities, About and Contact.  

  - Home page – This is the landing page with a hero image and descriptions and navigation to the other pages.  

  - Property details - This page provides information about each room of the house which contains images and text.  

  - Location - This page provides information about where the holiday cottage is located, geographically and provides options on different modes of transport on how to get there.  

  - Activities - This page provides details on what activities are available to participate in within the local area of the holiday cottage.  

  - About - This page provides some brief and basic information from the owners of the holiday cottage to allow users to see the people behind the project.  

  - Contact - This page provides a contact form to allow users to contact the owners with questions regarding their potential stay or to enquire about returning as a tenant.  

  - Each page features a main ‘call to action’ which is achieved through a combination of images and buttons. The aim was to allow users to get to the information the page has to offer in as few steps as possible.
