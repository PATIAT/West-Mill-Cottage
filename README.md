# West Mill Cottage  

## Code Institute Milestone Project 1 – Static Front End Project  

<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/west-mill-cottage-mockup.png"></h2>

*  West Mill Cottage is a blissfully tranquil riverside cottage set in rural countryside where England meets Scotland. The objective of the website is to appeal to prospective and returning tenants. The website is designed to be fully responsive so that the users experience is consistent across any device.   

* This website has been developed for the Milestone Project 1 submission as part of the Diploma in Web Application Development course facilitated by Code Institute and City of Bristol College.  

* This static front end website has been built using the different programming languages learned during the course, including HTML and CSS. The website has also utilised the Bootstrap framework technology.

## Design  

### Colour Scheme  

#### Primary Colours
<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/primary_colours.png"></h2>  

#### Secondary Colours
<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/secondary_colours.png"></h2>  

 - A simple colour scheme has been used with three primary colours and three secondary colours. The colours are all relatively light with dark type being used in contrast to give a refined and clean appearance.  

- This colour pallette has been chosen with the website imagery in mind. This is because the images are going to be what catch the user's attention.  

- I used the [Material Design Colour Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0) to decide on colour choices.  

### Typography  

- Headings are in Aboreto and normal text is in Lato. Aboreto is a cursive font which is eyecathing and sophisticated which is in keeping with the style of the holiday cottage. Therefore cursive is the fallback font should Aboreto be unavailable. Lato is a clean and legible font which is commonly used for websites all over the world. Sans serif is the fallback font should Lato be unavailable.  

### Imagery  

- The images have been provided by the business owners and offer a genuine representation of the standard of the holiday cottage. The images are therefore a very important feature of the website as they must be of high quality to portray the holiday cottage in the same light.  

- Each of the pages uses different image layouts, this is due to the focus and purpose of each page being different e.g., carousel on the home page to give a taste and more focused images on the property details page e.g., kitchen, bathroom etc.  

- Most of the images are in landscape orientation and the use of the same aspect ratio for all images allows for a consistent user experience.  

- Both ARIA roles and attributes as will as alt tags have been used to assist users with disabilities.

### Icons  

- All icons were sourced from Font Awesome and have been used sparingly across each page to allow for a more focused approach to catch the users attention.  

- Screen reader utilities such as sr-only have been utilised to assist users with disabilities.

## Structure  

### Website Architecture  

- This website has a home page and a further 5 pages, namely;    Property Details, Location, Activities, About and Contact.  

  - Home page – This is the landing page with a hero image and descriptions and navigation to the other pages.  

  - Property details - This page provides information about each room of the house which contains images and text.  

  - Location - This page provides information about where the holiday cottage is located, geographically and provides options on different modes of transport on how to get there.  

  - Activities - This page provides details on what activities are available to participate in within the local area of the holiday cottage.  

  - About - This page provides some brief and basic information from the owners of the holiday cottage to allow users to see the people behind the project.  

  - Contact - This page provides a contact form to allow users to contact the owners with questions regarding their potential stay or to enquire about returning as a tenant.  

  - Each page features a main ‘call to action’ which is achieved through a combination of images and buttons. The aim was to allow users to get to the information the page has to offer in as few steps as possible. 

  - The website utilises continuous scrolling pages and collapsible menus to display the majority of its information.

  - Visually impaired users and those with disabilities have been considered and a semantic layout has been utilised in combination with aria roles and attributes. 

### Headings and sub headings 

  - Each page of the website contains a heading to consistently show the user what to expect on each page. 
 
  - All of the pages have subheadings to clearly demonstrate a separation of content that helps the user experience when navigating the content. 

<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/page_heading.png"></h2> 

### Navigation Bar 

  - Each of the pages maintains the same navigation section which allows all users to easily navigate between the pages without having to use the browser or return to the homepage.  

  - The website utilises a collapsible navigation bar which shrinks as the screen size decreases until a hamburger icon is used to open and close the navigation menu.

  - The navigation bar was sourced from bootstrap documentation and has been customised using CSS to create a unique background, font and colour combination.

  - The active page is shown in a different colour to the rest of the navigation links and is underlined while active. Aria controls are in place to assist visually impaired users. This along with the hover changes were implemented with the use of CSS and bootstrap. 

  - Each page, except location.html and contact.html has a back to top of page button at the bottom of each page, just above the footer. This was implemented to improve user experience and reduce swipes and scrolls of screens. 

<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/navigation_desktop.png"></h2> 
<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/navigation_mobile.png"></h2> 
<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/button_back_to_top.png"></h2> 

### Buttons 

  - The buttons used across the pages are consistent throughout using the colour palletes of the primary and secondary colours as details above.  

  - The text on each of the buttons is followed by a greater than sign to guide the user to follow the link. 

  - The buttons use a hover class so when the user hovers over it, it changes colour. Both colour variants were assessed and determined to be legible. 

  - Bootstrap buttons were used and customised with CSS.

<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/button_dark.png"></h2> 
<h2 align="left"><img src="assets/readme-images/button_light.png"></h2> 

### Footer 

  - The footer is consistent on each page and contains the logo, address, telephone, email and social media links. 

  - The telephone and email links have been added and tel and mailto links. 

  - All links to external social media sites open in a new tab. 

  - The social media icons were source from font awesome.

# Features 
 
## Current Features 
 
### Responsive on all device sizes 

  - The development of this website was mobile first, therefore the website is fully responsive on all device screen sizes. 

  - I have used the Bootstrap grid concept and adjusted the layout according to the size of the devices screen size. In some cases this was facilitated by the use of CSS media queries.

### User interaction 

  - Image carousels on the home page feature forward and backward buttons which the user is able to control. 

  - There is an accordian on the property details page which the user is able to click to show and hide the information.

  - A google maps iframe has been included on the location page to allow users to acquaint themselves with the geographical location of the holiday cottage. 

  - The navbar turns into a drop down (hamburger on smaller devices). 

## Future Features 

### Bookings 

  - A booking form which allows users to choose dates for a potential stay could be developed and included. 

### Affiliate program with local businesses 

  - Users who book with the site could benefit from discounts to local events and activities to promote other local businesses. 

### E-commerce 

  - The website could offer merchandise related to the holiday cottage or local area attractions for people to buy as souvenirs or gifts. 

### Reviews

  - Genuine reviews could be displayed on the website or via a third party widget such as Trust Pilot.

# Deployment

## Forking the GitHub Repository

Forks are used to propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository.

To Fork a Github Repository:

1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PATIAT/west-mill-cottage)
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. Select an owner for the forked repository.
4. By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
5. Optionally, add a description of your fork.
6. Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.
7. Click Create fork.
8. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

You will now have a fork of the repository, but you don't have the files in that repository locally on your computer.

To make a local clone:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PATIAT/west-mill-cottage)
2. Above the list of files, click  Code.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
  - To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click the 'Copy' icon. 
  - To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click the 'Copy' icon. 
  - To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click the 'Copy' icon.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `milestone-project-one`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) for the GitHub quick start guide with images and more detailed explanations of the above process.

## GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PATIAT/west-mill-cottage)
2. Locate the Navbar at the top of the Repository (not top of page). Click the Settings tab.
3. Locate the Navbar on the left hand side of the page. Click the "Pages" section (under 'Code and automation').
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "main". Click save.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. A notification will appear at the top of the page with the [link](https://patiat.github.io/west-mill-cottage/index.html) to the deployed site. You can return to this GitHub Pages section to access the link.

# Credits

## Code

-   [Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/): The Bootstrap library was utilised throughout the development of the project to make site responsive using the Bootstrap Grid System and Flexbox. Bootstrap documentation was referred to when developing the Navigation, Carousel, Accordian, Buttons and Contact Form. 

-   [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/): I used the Code Institute's learning management system to remind myself of certain lessons and to use specific code from some of the projects done during the course. For example, the footer from the Resume project and the use of the iFrame from the Coders Coffee House Lessons.

## Content

-   The content was provided by the Cottage owners and has been embellished upon to make it more suitable for online consumption.
    - [Luxury Cottages](https://www.luxurycottages.co.uk/) - for general inspiration regarding holiday cottages.
    - [Unique Home Stay](https://www.uniquehomestays.com/) - for general inspiration regarding holiday cottages.

- To develop this README file I referred to the [Code Institute's Sample README](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME/blob/master/README.md). This can also be said for the TESTING file which followed the same format.

## Acknowledgements

- Thank you to my Code Institute Tutor Chris Quinn for helpful feedback, pointers and tips that I would never have though of on my own.

- Thank you to the tutors and staff at Code Institute and City of Bristol College for their support.

This website for West Mill Cottage, although a real life holiday cottage is for educational purposes only and for the development of a portfolio.
